# Quake4 Realism Mod

Welcome to the Quake4 Realism Mod repository! This mod is designed to bridge the gap between the iconic sci-fi first-person shooter, Quake4, and a more grounded military simulation game.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

### Player Effects:

* **Broken Limb**: Experience the harsh reality of the battlefield. When seriously injured, your character may suffer from a broken limb, affecting movement and combat capabilities.
  
* **Fracture**: Not as severe as a broken limb but can still hinder your actions.
  
* **Pain**: Feel the agony from injuries
  
* **Bleeds**:
  * **Heavy Bleed**: Famage can lead to heavy bleeding, which can drastically reduce your health.
  * **Light Bleed**: Damage can cause light bleeding, which can be a nuisance in the heat of battle.

### Gun Mods:

* **Suppressor**: Stay stealthy and reduce the noise of your shots to sneak past enemies or take them down silently.
  
* **Compensator**: Improve the damage of your shots by enabling the compensator.
  
* **Extended Barrel**: Enhance the range and velocity of your bullets, allowing for more damage to be dealt.

### Modern Weapons:

Three new additions to the default loadout to give you a feel of modern combat:
  
* **M4A1**: A versatile and widely-used assault rifle known for its reliability and accuracy.
  
* **Five Seven**: A semi-automatic pistol with a high capacity magazine, perfect for close-quarters combat.
  
* **MP-155**: A powerful shotgun to ensure no enemy stands in your way.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The main intent behind creating this mod was to infuse a sense of realism into Quake4. While the game originally leaned more towards science fiction and alien warfare, with this mod, players can now experience the game as if they're in a gritty military simulation, emphasizing the harsh realities of combat.
